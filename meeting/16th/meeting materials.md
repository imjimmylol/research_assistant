# A. Paper Review : Payout and divid

1. divid 有人說正有人說負，有衝突可以寫在proposal 上 還有 shock 很關鍵 
2. 再回去看logic
3. 把buyback當成paout

## 1. Divid

有蠻多在探討div發放，但是都沒有發在不錯的期刊

- Mandatory corporate social responsibility disclosure and dividend payouts: evidence from a quasi-natural experiment

  可能沒發在頂刊的原因是因為在<mark>探討CSR disclosure對shareholder welfare 的影響</mark>

  - Accounting and Finance (2019)

  - x : CSR/ESG factors

  - y : *Divasset* (the ratio of cash dividend payouts to total assets); *Divsale* (the ratio of cash dividend payouts to total sales)

  - shock : China Govern disclosure law

  - status :  few existing studies reveal direct channels through which CSR disclosure affects shareholder welfare. In this paper, we fill this gap by focusing on dividend payouts, which represent incomes for shareholders and reflect one of the typical forms of shareholder–stakeholder conflicts.

  - Main Conclusion : mandatory __CSR disclosure reduces firms' dividend payouts significantly__

    

- Corporate social responsibility and dividend policy

  沒發到頂可能是因為沒有shock去解決內生性問題(但本文採用Heckman sample selection model去解決)
  
  - Research in International Business and Finance (2019)
  
  - x : CSR/ESG factors
  
  - y : Dividends
  
  - argument : <mark>the relation between CSR and divid payout</mark>
  
  - status : fills an important gap in the literature on CSR and finance as little work has been done on the relationship between CSR and dividend policy
  
  - hypo1:
  
    - Cause : dividend policy serves as a disciplinary mechanism that avoids social overinvestment and prevents managers from wasting
      cash through high social expenditures
    - result : positive relationship between CSR and dividend payout
  
    hypo2:
  
    - Cause : signals that CSR expenditures are far from exhausting firm’s cash and lead to a better allocation of a company’s resources
    -  result : positive relationship between CSR and dividend payout
  
  - Main Conclusion : socially irresponsible firms adjust dividends more rapidly than socially responsible firms do: dividend payout is more stable in high CSR firms
  
## 2. Payout (Buy back)

幾乎查不到什麼文獻（小期刊也沒有，只有零散文章）

- U.S. Corporate Boards Suffer from Inadequate Expertise in Financially Material ESG Matters

  The article suggests that in __COVID__ crisis,  while corporate announced significant layoff, they still pay dividend and also issue share buyback


- Shareholder value and dividend policy: the role of ESG strategies (working discussion paper)

  - Funded by Predistribution Initiative

  - Goal : how the growth of institutional investors (asset owners and allocators) and certain asset allocation strategies can be in conflict with ESG objectives 
  
  - E.g Dividend policy and worker pay
