# B. Application in Paper

## 1. AER 

The goal of this paper wants to measure the people's WTP of health, thus needs a shock indicating dramatic change in the air quality (which comes in the NOx budget trading program) 

## 2. JCF 

- inspire by article describing the relation of people's mental health and behavior 

The goal of this paper is to study whether air quality affect innovation (reduction in air pollution making people less risk-averse and more capable in the innovation process, resulting in higher levels of innovation output )
