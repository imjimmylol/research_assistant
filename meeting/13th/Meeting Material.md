# 2. Controversial Empirical Result

## 2.1 Family Ownership ESG

看看這些文章被發在哪裡，看引用，再回去看文章。看這三篇是否為代表

- Positive : Family owned firms are more responsible to shareholder in environmental investment 
  - Abeysekera and Fernando (2020)
  - Gillan, Sekerci, and Starks (2020)      
- Negative : family-controlled frms have lower ESG/CSR performance  
  - El Ghoul et al. (2016)  
- Conflict : differences in geography or differences in data and methodology ?  

# 3. Future Research

## 3.1 Market Characteristic 

- Future Research Direction 

  - the importance of corporate stakeholders in a frm’s ESG/CSR decisions could be examined more closely  
  
  
    - research that considers the demographics of employees could provide additional insights  (印象中有了)
      - __查CEO Pay ratio ? (Pan et al.(2022) JF ) / Income equality__
  
  
    - political leanings of corporate stakeholders  
  
- Ambiguous Mechanism 

  - ESG and corporate leaders (e.g gender or political leanings)
  - 查一下political leanings 
    - ESG/CSR cores are associated with differences in CEO preferences, to the extent that gender reﬂects these preferences
    - women are better at governing frms   

- Conflicting Result

  - Negative associations between ESG/CSR scores in CEO pay


  - no significant difference 

## 3.2 Ownership Structure

- Research Direction __(Dead End)__
  - Cost of Capital is lower when ESG higher

- Future Research Direction 

  - ESG and firm value (等等回去看之前firm value 的文章) __可能可以寫提案__

  - Is it possible to come up with a general theory which can explain the disparate findings?
