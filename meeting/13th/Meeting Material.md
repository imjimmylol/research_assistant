# 3. Future Research

## 3.1 Market Characteristic 

- Future Research Direction 

  - the importance of corporate stakeholders in a frm’s ESG/CSR decisions could be examined more closely  
  
  
    - research that considers the demographics of employees could provide additional insights  (印象中有了)
  
  
    - political leanings of corporate stakeholders  
  
- Ambiguous Mechanism (應該相對不重要，重點是有這結果的文章就好)

  - ESG and corporate leaders (e.g gender or political leanings)

    - ESG/CSR cores are associated with differences in CEO preferences, to the extent that gender reﬂects these preferences
    - women are better at governing frms   

- Conflicting Result


  - Negative associations between ESG/CSR scores in CEO pay
  - no significant difference 

  

## 3.2 Ownership Structure

- Research Direction __(Dead End)__
  - Cost of Capital is lower when ESG higher

- Future Research Direction 

  - ESG and firm value (等等回去看之前firm value 的文章)

  - Is it possible to come up with a general theory which can explain the disparate findings?
