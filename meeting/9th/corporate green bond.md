## A. Summary 

<br>

### 1. Signaling 

By issuing green bonds, companies can __signal their commitment toward the environment__ and reduce information asymmetry. 

#### 1.1 stock market reaction to the issuance of green bond  

- ##### 1.1.1 Methodology
  - data set : Bloomberg data base of green bond announcing date
  - CAR : actual return - CAPM return 
  
- ##### 1.1.2 Results
    - certified (by third party) green bond represent a more credible signal of the company's commitment (stronger effect of signaling) [Appendix.Fig1](#1)
    - __abnormal returns are large and significant for first-time issuers__ but are small and insignificant for seasoned issuers  [Appendix.Fig1](#1)
    - abnormal __returns are only significant in industries where the natural environment is financially material to the firms’ operations  __ [Appendix.Fig1](#1)

### 2. Green washing 

If indeed the greenwashing motive prevails, one would not expect any improvement in environmental performance following the issuance of corporate green bonds:   $$ \implies $$ __$$ \nexists $$ green washing if there is an actual output of green bond project __

#### 2.1 Corporate green bonds and firm-level outcomes

- ##### 2.1.1 Methodology 

  - Firm outcome 
    - environmental rating of ASSET4
    - CO2 emission / book value of assets

  - Ownership structure
    Whether the issue change the structure of holdings
    - Thomson Reuters 

  - Matching 

    build a plausible counterfactual of how firm-level outcomes would evolve absent the green bond issue, I use a matching approach  (Firms with and without green bond )
    
    - regression model containing dummy variable ( green bond )
  
 - ##### 2.1.2 Results

   - companies improve their environmental performance following the issuance of green bonds.  (inconsistent with green bond is a green washing tool ) [Appendix.Fig2](#2)
   - Institutional ownership increase is insignificant / significant increase in long term investor and green investors [Appendix.Fig3](#3)
   - the above results are more significant with __certificated__ green bond [Appendix.Fig4](#4)

We take advantage of unique institutional features of the municipal securities market to provide insight into this question. Since 2013, states and other governmental entities have issued over $23 billion of green bonds to fund eco-friendly projects. Comparing green securities to nearly identical securities issued for non-green purposes by the same issuers on the same day, we observe economically identical pricing for green and non-green issues. In contrast to a number of recent theoretical and experimental studies, we find that in real market settings investors appear entirely unwilling to forgo wealth to invest in environmentally sustainable projects. When risk and payoffs are held constant and are known to investors ex-ante, investors view green and non-green securities by the same issuer as almost exact substitutes. Thus, the __greenium is essentially zero.__ | no pricing difference in green and brown bonds <font color=#F00>(municipal bonds)</font> |

We perform a matching method, followed by a two-step regression procedure, to estimate the yield differential between a green bond and a counterfactual conventional bond from July 2013 to December 2017. <font color=#F00>__The results suggest a small negative premium: the yield of a green bond is lower than that of a conventional bond.__</font> On average, the premium is -2 basis points for the entire sample and for euro and USD bonds separately. We show that this negative premium is more pronounced for financial and low-rated bonds. The results emphasize the <font color=#F00>__low impact of investors' pro-environmental preferences on bond prices__</font>, which does not represent, at this stage, a disincentive for investors to support the expansion of the green bond market.

| JCF | 2020 | (Do shareholders benefit from green bonds?)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0929119918301664] | The green bond market has been growing rapidly worldwide since its debut in 2007. We present the __first empirical study on the announcement returns and real effects of green bond issuance by firms in 28 countries during 2007–2017__. After compiling a comprehensive international green bond dataset, we document that __stock prices positively respond to green bond issuance__. However, we __do not find a consistently significant premium for green bonds__, suggesting that the positive stock returns around green bond announcements are not fully driven by the lower cost of debt. Nevertheless, we show that institutional ownership, especially from domestic institutions, increases after the firm issues green bonds. Moreover, stock liquidity significantly improves upon the issuance of green bonds. Overall, our findings suggest that the firm's issuance of green bonds is beneficial to its existing shareholders. | Consist with the first part of the study (positive stock shock) |
| __JFE__ | 2021 | (Impact investing)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X2030194X] | We show that investors derive nonpecuniary utility from investing in dual-objective Venture Capital (VC) funds, thus sacrificing returns. Impact funds earn 4.7 percentage points (ppts) lower internal rates of return (IRRs) ex-post than traditional VC funds. In random utility/willingness-to-pay (WTP) models investors accept 2.5–3.7 ppts lower IRRs ex ante for impact funds. The positive WTP result is robust to fund access rationing and investor heterogeneity in fund expected returns. Development organizations, foundations, financial institutions, public pensions, Europeans, and United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment signatories have high WTP. Investors with mission objectives and/or facing political pressure exhibit high WTP; those subject to legal restrictions (e.g., Employee Retirement Income Security Act) exhibit low WTP. | set of financial instruments __<font color=#F00>(i.e green bonds) </font>__which generates 'social xand environmental impact along side financial return ' |

A Regression Discontinuity Approach](https://www-webofscience-com.autorpa.lib.nccu.edu.tw/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000364828700001) | This study examines the effect of shareholder proposals related to corporate social responsibility (CSR) on financial performance. Specifically, I focus on CSR proposals that pass or fail by a small margin of votes. The passage of such "close call" proposals is akin to a random assignment of CSR to companies and hence provides a quasi-experiment to study the effect of CSR on performance. I find that the __adoption of close call CSR proposals leads to positive announcement returns and superior accounting performance__, implying that these proposals are value enhancing. When I examine the channels through which companies benefit from CSR, I find that labor productivity and sales growth increase after the vote. Finally, I document that close call CSR proposals differ from non-close proposals along several dimensions. Accordingly, although my results imply that adopting close call CSR proposals is beneficial to companies, they do not necessarily imply that CSR proposals are beneficial in general. | corresponding to the part of  positive shock of stock market while issuing green bonds |
