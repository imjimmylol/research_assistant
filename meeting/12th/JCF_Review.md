## 1. Firms’ ESG/CSR attributes and market characteristics  

Explanation : how frms’ ESG/CSR attributes relate to characteristics of the markets in which firms operate

__Independent variable : market characteristic__ (x)

__Dependent variable : frms’ ESG/CSR attributes__ (y)

- country characteristics appear to be quite important in explaining firm’s ESG/CSR activities 

- country attributes appear to be less important for companies whose operations span borders or are crosslisted  

- Within-country variation in market characteristics is also important  

- Firms’ ESG/CSR practices also tend to have a strong industry component

## 2. Firms’ ESG/CSR practices and boards, executives, and executive compensation    

Explanation : firm management and the environmental and social aspects of a firm’s ESG/CSR activities

- director exposed to changes in regulations and reporting requirements --> increase ESG/CSR performance
-  Firms ESG/CSR activities are associated with variation in CEO and board characteristics (e.g Gender /  children of CEO)
- CEO compensation and CSR/ESG (CSR ESG served as penalty for CEO) --> some find negative / some find unrelated

## 3. Firms’ ESG/CSR attributes and ownership characteristics 

### 3.1 Institutional investor ownership  

NOTE：not all agree with the sign of relationship /  different measures of  ESG/CSR profiles / 

- Institutional ownership is negatively related to ESG/CSR score, but decline with low score
- particular type of institutional investor is important for understanding shareholder preferences  
  - ( pension fund / fund managers that donate to Democratic politicians ) have a distaste for socially irresponsible stocks  
- __reverse causality ：presence of institutional shareholders affects managers’ ESG/CSR choices __
- Peer effects 

Problems unsolved : Reverse causality is unsolved, so there needs further research (__ex. strong external shock / dynamic effects of both elements__)

### 3.2 Family ownership  

- in decisions about environmental investments, U.S. family firms are more responsible to shareholders than are the non-family firms  

### 3.3 State ownership  

- state-owned firms are more engaged in environmental and social issues than other firms, a result concentrated in energy firms and firms in emerging economies  

  

- before their privatization, the privatized frms have higher ESG/CSR scores in aggregate, and on both the
  Environmental and Social dimensions, than other publicly listed frms  

## 4. Firms’ ESG/CSR attributes and frm risk  

risk type：systematic risk / regulatory risk / supply chain risk/ product and technology risk/ litigation risk/ reputational risk/  physical risk   

### 4.1 Risk measures 

- lower systematic risk exposures
- perform better in financial crisis 
- face a relatively less price elastic demand  
- lower risk because wider investor base relative to irresponsible firms
- bond credit ratings as measures of frms’ risk  

  - ESG/CSR leads to more favorable bond ratings  

  - Do not effect credit rating  but yield other score benefits in country with above average ESG/CSR score
- frm’s bond credit ratings and yield spreads are related to environmental scores and to
climate regulatory risk
- reduce legal risk  

### 4.2 Cost of capital

## 5. Firms’ ESG/CSR attributes and firm performance and value  

whether management choices with regard to corporate responsibility affect firm performance and firm value  

- greater ESG/CSR performance can increase frm value by following way
  - increase shareholder wealth 
    - increasing cash flow 
    - discount rate (eg cost of capital)
  - Max share holder utility 
- __concern both causality predict a positive association between performance and shareholder wealth__
  - which direction ?
- __selection effects __
  - effects more than CSR/ESG
